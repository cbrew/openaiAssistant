# Some basic demos of OpenAI's Assistant framework

1. demo1.py -- generate poetry
2. demo2.py -- solve a tricky math problem
3. demo3.py -- solve an easier math problem, but use asyncio for practice.

To run these you need an OpenAI key, and you should place it in a file called .env
in the following format
```text
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_key>
```
